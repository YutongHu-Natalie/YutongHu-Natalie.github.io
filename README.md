**Senior Undergraduate Student**  
Emory University  
**Major:** Computer Science | **Minor:** Applied Mathematics & Statistics  

My research interests primarily lie in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, where I have participated in several projects at the **Emory NLP Lab**. I also participated in **Computer Vision** projects in the healthcare domain. Looking ahead, I am eager to explore more **multimodal** research projects that integrate text, vision, and other modalities.
